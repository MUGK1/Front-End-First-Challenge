Some HTML and scss code I'm proud of: 

```html
<svg class="order__icon">
     <use xlink:href="images/sprite.svg#icon-icon-music"></use>
</svg> 
```
```scss
@mixin size($breakpoint) {

    @if $breakpoint == phone {
        @media only screen and (max-width:23.4em /*375px*/) {
            @content;
        }
    }
    
}
```
